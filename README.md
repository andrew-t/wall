An HTML Connecting Wall

The sixteen items on the grid can be divided into four groups of four. Every item must be used exactly once. Some items may fit into multiple groups, but there should only be one way to divide up the sixteen items without leaving any items unused.
				
To play: click four items. If they are a correct group, they will be moved away. If not, the board will go dead for a short time before you can try again. You cannot lose lives until you have found two complete sets. Thereafter, an incorrect guess will cost you one life. If you run out of lives or time then the board will freeze.
				
When you correctly divide up the board, or the answers are revealed to you, you may guess what the groups were for bonus points.
