				In February 2012, I contacted a charity, offering them a free website redesign which they badly needed, so I would have something to put in my portfolio. They said no, thank you, they liked their frames-and-image-links website. Then I imagine they listened to <em>Waterfalls</em> by TLC, complained about John Major's premiership, and vaguely wondered to themselves if buying a job lot of calendars in 1995 was as forward-thinking a move as they'd thought at the time.

				Still needing a portfolio piece, I decided to make something fun instead. This toy is based on the BBC TV show <em>Only Connect</em>. It allows you to play the popular "Connecting Wall" round. There's a similar game on the BBC's website, but their version requires Flash and therefore will not run on iOS devices. This version is built entirely from JavaScript and CSS and so should run in any modern browser.
